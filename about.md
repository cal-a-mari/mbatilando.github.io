### About Me
I'm a young software engineer who recently graduated from UC Berkeley. I started my programming career during college by doing front-end web development. Programming in JavaSript gradually expanded onto the server-side and I'm capable of programming the full-stack.

I've recently changed my interest and decided to dive into native iOS development in Objective-C and Swift. Right now, I'm focusing on learning everything I can about mobile development.

Other than coding, I love to exercise. Currently, I'm working on running, biking and swimming so that I can do my first sprint triathlon! I also love to eat-- Thai and Vietnamese food are among my favorite. I'm also a maniacal Shiba Inu lover and spend hours scouring Instagram for cute pictures of Black and Tan Shibas.

I'm a big proponent of self-improvement and doing what you love-- which is why I made my personal website into a blog. This website is mainly for me to write about and reinforce what I learn as a software engineer (and also improve my horrendous writing skills). But hopefully this blog will be helpful visitors like you and other programmers who are looking to learn more about software development!
