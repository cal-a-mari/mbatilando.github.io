I'm a young software engineer from UC Berkeley. My skills are primarily in full-stack web development; however I've recently started learning Swift on iOS.

Other than coding, I'm an avid runner and I love to exercise. My current goal is to run my first triathlon! I'm also a maniacal Shiba Inu lover.
